### Branch: The Block Abstraction

In this project, your task is to write a kernel module that allows a user program (i.e., our testcases) to directly access a virtual USB storage device using the block abstraction.
Your kernel module should support both read and write operations of different block sizes, and at different offsets. Please refer to the project handout on Canvas for full details.
